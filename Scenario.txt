Question:1. Food Delivery Order Routing System
Scenario:
 A food delivery company assigns orders to delivery agents based on proximity and availability.
Requirements:
Store orders using Queue<Order>
Store delivery agents using List<Agent>
Assign orders FIFO to the nearest available agent
Use OOP: Order, Agent, DeliveryService
Throw NoAgentAvailableException if no agent is free
Use methods to assign, cancel, and view active deliveries

Concepts: Queue, List, OOP, Exception Handling



STEP 1: Strip the story (2 minutes)

Ignore “Smart”, “System”, “Routing”, “Management”.

Rewrite the problem in boring terms:

Orders go in a queue
Agents sit in a list
Assign first order to first free agent
If no agent → throw exception

That’s it.
If you can’t rewrite it this simply, you don’t understand it yet.

STEP 2: Extract NOUNS → Classes (3 minutes)

Underline nouns in the problem:
Order
Agent
DeliveryService
Boom.
Those are your classes.
No thinking. No creativity.

If a noun can “do something”, it’s a class.


STEP 3: Extract VERBS → Methods (3 minutes)

Underline actions:
assign
cancel
view

They go into DeliveryService, not everywhere.

👉 This is where beginners mess up:
They spread logic across all classes.

Rule:

Coordination logic always lives in ONE service class.

STEP 4: Extract DATA STRUCTURES (3 minutes)

Look for keywords:
Keyword	Structure
FIFO	Queue
collection of agents	List
“if none available”	Exception

Now the design is basically DONE.

STEP 5: Write EMPTY code first (4 minutes)

This is what you SHOULD write first — not full code:
